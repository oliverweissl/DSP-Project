eFlint Rules:
In eFlint, interpretations are formalized as type declarations.

Scenarios:
Scenarios are represented by series of statements, which create transition traces based on act-types and event-types.

Abstract Syntax:
eFlint specifications consist of type declarations. Boolean and instance expressions are omitted but introduced later.

Examples:
Example specifications like the Premarin Vaginal Cream usage norm are provided.

Type Redefinition:
Types can be redefined for domain-specific use.

Scripts:
Scripts are sequences of statements and queries. They describe actions and events in scenarios.

Input Files:
To assess cases, use four input files: type declarations, domain-specific type redefinitions, initialization statements, and scenario statements.

Facts and Configurations:
Facts represent the institutional model at a moment in time, forming configurations.

Derivation Clauses:
Type declarations may have optional derivation clauses (Boolean expressions) that define which instances are true.

Fact Types:
Facts can be 'derived' or 'postulated' based on the presence of derivation clauses.

Act-Types:
Act-types define actions with performing and recipient actors. Actions have post-conditions that change configurations.

Duty-Types:
Duty-types involve duty holders and claimants with violation conditions.

Transitions:
Actions and events trigger transitions, changing institutional views by creating or terminating facts.

Actions vs. Events:
Actions and events differ; events lack performing and recipient actors.

Invariants:
The language supports invariants that must hold true in every reachable configuration.

Violations:
Invariant violations are reported to identify inconsistencies in specifications.

Compliance:
A trace can be action-compliant, duty-compliant, both, or neither.

Scenario Assessment:
Evaluate scenarios for action and duty compliance based on the initial configuration.

Trace Recording:
Traces record normative positions and relations, aiding in reproducing and explaining decision-making processes.

Negative Boolean sentences are annotated using NOT(...)

Abstract Syntax:
Type Macrobid
Type UrinaryTractInfection

Scenario:
Statements:
Macrobid is used to treat urinary tract infections.
Transition Trace:
Uses Macrobid to treat UrinaryTractInfection

Example Specification:
Macrobid is a type declaration that is used to treat UrinaryTractInfection.

Type Redefinition:
Types can be redefined for specific use, such as using Macrobid to treat other types of infections.

Input Files:
To assess cases, use four input files: type declarations, domain-specific type redefinitions, initialization statements, and scenario statements.

Facts and Configurations:
Facts represent the institutional model at a moment in time, forming configurations.

Derivation Clauses:
Type Macrobid has a derivation clause that defines its use in treating UrinaryTractInfection.

Fact Types:
Facts can be derived based on the use of Macrobid to treat UrinaryTractInfection.

Act-Types:
Act-types define actions, such as using Macrobid, and have post-conditions that change configurations.

Duty-Types:
Duty-types involve duty holders, such as the individual prescribing Macrobid, and claimants, such as the patient with the urinary tract infection, with violation conditions.

Transitions:
Using Macrobid to treat a urinary tract infection triggers a transition, changing the institutional view by creating or terminating facts.

Actions vs. Events:
Using Macrobid is an action, while the presence of a urinary tract infection is an event.

Invariants:
The language supports invariants, such as ensuring that Macrobid is only used to treat urinary tract infections.

Violations:
Invariant violations, such as using Macrobid for a different type of infection, are reported to identify inconsistencies in specifications.

Compliance:
A trace can be both action and duty compliant when Macrobid is used to treat a urinary tract infection.

Scenario Assessment:
Evaluate the scenario of using Macrobid to treat a urinary tract infection for action and duty compliance based on the initial configuration.

Trace Recording:
Traces record normative positions and relations, aiding in reproducing and explaining decision-making processes."

Type Declaration: Duragesic_patch is a type of prescription pain medicine.

Scenario: The use of Duragesic patches to treat chronic pain in opioid-tolerant patients.

Abstract Syntax: Duragesic_patch specifications consist of type declarations.

Example: A specification example would be the use of Duragesic patches to treat severe chronic pain in opioid-tolerant patients.

Type Redefinition: Duragesic_patches can be redefined for specific use in treating chronic pain in opioid-tolerant patients.

Scripts: The use of Duragesic patches involves administering the patches daily and continuously for long-term treatment.

Input Files: To assess the use of Duragesic patches, we need input files including type declarations, specific type redefinitions, initialization statements, and scenario statements.

Facts and Configurations: Facts represent the current use of Duragesic patches in treating chronic pain in opioid-tolerant patients, forming configurations.

Derivation Clauses: Type declarations may have optional derivation clauses that define the conditions under which Duragesic patches are used to treat chronic pain in opioid-tolerant patients.

Fact Types: Facts can be 'derived' or 'postulated' based on the presence of derivation clauses, such as the use of Duragesic patches in treating chronic pain in opioid-tolerant patients.

Act-Types: The administration of Duragesic patches is an act-type involving the patient and the healthcare provider. The act has post-conditions that change the current use of Duragesic patches.

Duty-Types: Healthcare providers have a duty to properly prescribe and administer Duragesic patches to patients with chronic pain. Violation of this duty can result in negative consequences for the patient.

Transitions: The administration of Duragesic patches triggers a transition in the treatment of chronic pain, changing the current use of Duragesic patches.

Actions vs. Events: The administration of Duragesic patches is an action involving the patient and the healthcare provider, while the occurrence of chronic pain is an event lacking performing and recipient actors.

Invariants: The language supports invariants that must hold true in every reachable configuration, such as the proper use of Duragesic patches in treating chronic pain in opioid-tolerant patients.

Violations: Invariant violations, such as the improper use of Duragesic patches, can be reported to identify inconsistencies in the treatment process.

Compliance: The use of Duragesic patches can be evaluated for compliance with proper administration and treatment of chronic pain.

Scenario Assessment: The use of Duragesic patches in treating chronic pain can be evaluated for compliance with the initial configuration and treatment plan.

Trace Recording: Traces can be used to record the administration and use of Duragesic patches in treating chronic pain, aiding in reproducing and explaining the treatment process. Negative Boolean sentences, such as NOT(treatment plan), are annotated to identify any errors or discrepancies in the treatment plan."

Type Declaration: Triamcinolone Injection
Scenario: Treatment
Statements: Used to treat inflammation, allergic reactions, certain types of arthritis, gout, and skin diseases
Transition Traces: Based on act-types and event-types
Abstract Syntax: Triamcinolone Injection specifications consist of type declarations
Boolean and instance expressions: Omitted, but can be introduced later
Examples: Example specifications for Triamcinolone Injection's use in treating various conditions are provided
Type Redefinition: Types can be redefined for specific medical conditions
Scripts: Scripts are sequences of statements and queries, describing the treatment process
Input Files: To assess cases, use four input files: type declarations, medical condition-specific type redefinitions, initialization statements, and treatment statements
Facts and Configurations: Facts represent the patient's medical condition at a specific moment in time, forming configurations
Derivation Clauses: Type declarations may have optional derivation clauses (Boolean expressions) that define which instances are true
Fact Types: Facts can be 'derived' or 'postulated' based on the presence of derivation clauses
Act-Types: Act-types define medical actions with performing and recipient actors. Actions have post-conditions that change configurations
Duty-Types: Duty-types involve healthcare providers and patients, with violation conditions
Transitions: Medical actions and events trigger transitions, changing the patient's medical condition by creating or terminating facts
Actions vs. Events: Medical actions and events differ; events lack performing and recipient actors
Invariants: The language supports invariants that must hold true in every reachable configuration, ensuring proper treatment
Violations: Invariant violations are reported to identify inconsistencies in specifications, ensuring safe and effective treatment
Compliance: A trace can be action-compliant, duty-compliant, both, or neither, indicating the success of the treatment
Scenario Assessment: Evaluate scenarios for action and duty compliance based on the initial configuration, ensuring proper treatment
Trace Recording: Traces record medical actions and their effects, aiding in reproducing and explaining the treatment process
Negative Boolean sentences are annotated using NOT(...) to indicate the absence of certain medical conditions."

Input Files:
- Medicine type declaration
- Pancreatitis type redefinition
- Initialization statements
- Scenario statements

Facts and Configurations:
Facts represent the presence of pancreatitis in a person due to use of the medicine

Derivation Clauses:
Type declaration of medicine may have optional clauses to define instances where pancreatitis may occur

Fact Types:
Pancreatitis can be derived or postulated based on the presence of derivation clauses in the medicine type declaration

Act-Types:
Act-types define actions of taking the medicine and experiencing pancreatitis as a result

Duty-Types:
Duty-types involve the duty of the person taking the medicine to seek medical attention if experiencing signs of pancreatitis

Transitions:
Taking the medicine and experiencing signs of pancreatitis trigger a transition, changing the institutional view of the person's health

Actions vs. Events:
Taking the medicine is an action, while experiencing signs of pancreatitis is an event

Invariants:
The language supports invariants that must hold true in every reachable configuration, such as the duty to seek medical attention if experiencing signs of pancreatitis

Violations:
Violation of invariants, such as not seeking medical attention when experiencing signs of pancreatitis, will be reported to identify inconsistencies in the specifications

Compliance:
A trace can be action-compliant, duty-compliant, both, or neither, depending on the actions taken and the person's compliance with seeking medical attention

Scenario Assessment:
Evaluate scenarios for action and duty compliance based on the initial configuration of taking the medicine and experiencing signs of pancreatitis

Trace Recording:
Traces can record the sequence of events and actions leading to the development of pancreatitis, aiding in understanding and explaining the decision-making process. Negative Boolean sentences, such as not seeking medical attention, are annotated using NOT(...) to indicate non-compliance. "

Type Declaration:
Medicine: String

Scenario:
Store Medicine:
Statements:
- Store(medicine)
- Close(container)
- SetTemperature(room temperature)
- KeepAwayFrom(heat)
- KeepAwayFrom(moisture)
- KeepAwayFrom(direct light)
- KeepFromFreezing()

Abstract Syntax:
Medicine specifications consist of type declarations. Boolean and instance expressions are omitted but introduced later.

Example:
Example specification for storing medicine is provided.

Type Redefinition:
Types can be redefined for domain-specific use.

Scripts:
Scripts are sequences of statements and queries. They describe actions and events in scenarios.

Input Files:
To assess cases, use four input files: type declarations, domain-specific type redefinitions, initialization statements, and scenario statements.

Facts and Configurations:
Facts represent the institutional model at a moment in time, forming configurations.

Derivation Clauses:
Type declarations may have optional derivation clauses (Boolean expressions) that define which instances are true.

Fact Types:
Facts can be 'derived' or 'postulated' based on the presence of derivation clauses.

Act-Types:
Act-types define actions with performing and recipient actors. Actions have post-conditions that change configurations.

Duty-Types:
Duty-types involve duty holders and claimants with violation conditions.

Transitions:
Actions and events trigger transitions, changing institutional views by creating or terminating facts.

Actions vs. Events:
Actions and events differ; events lack performing and recipient actors.

Invariants:
The language supports invariants that must hold true in every reachable configuration.

Violations:
Invariant violations are reported to identify inconsistencies in specifications.

Compliance:
A trace can be action-compliant, duty-compliant, both, or neither.

Scenario Assessment:
Evaluate scenarios for action and duty compliance based on the initial configuration.

Trace Recording:
Traces record normative positions and relations, aiding in reproducing and explaining decision-making processes.

Negative Boolean Sentences:
Negative Boolean sentences are annotated using NOT(...)

Scenario: Patient reports new or worsening symptoms to their doctor.
Abstract Syntax: ReportSymptoms(patient, doctor)
Examples: Example scenario of a patient reporting symptoms to their doctor.
Type Redefinition: Patient and doctor types can be redefined for specific medical contexts.
Scripts: Scripts consist of statements and queries for describing patient-doctor interactions.
Input Files: Four input files are used for this scenario: patient and doctor type declarations, redefinitions, and initialization statements.
Facts and Configurations: Facts represent the patient's current medical state and configurations are formed by these facts.
Derivation Clauses: Type declarations may have optional derivation clauses (Boolean expressions) that define when a fact is true.
Fact Types: Facts can be 'derived' or 'postulated' based on the presence of derivation clauses.
Act-Types: Act-types define actions with the patient as the performing actor and the doctor as the recipient actor.
Actions have post-conditions that change configurations.
Duty-Types: Duty-types involve the doctor as the duty holder and the patient as the claimant.
Violations: Violations occur when the patient does not report new or worsening symptoms to their doctor.
Transitions: Actions trigger transitions, changing the patient's medical state and creating or terminating facts.
Actions vs. Events: Reporting symptoms is an action, while changes in the patient's mental state are events.
Invariants: The language supports invariants that must hold true in every reachable configuration.
Compliance: A trace can be action-compliant, duty-compliant, both, or neither.
Scenario Assessment: Evaluate the scenario for action and duty compliance based on the initial configuration.
Trace Recording: Traces record the patient's medical state and interactions with the doctor, aiding in understanding the decision-making process."

Act-Type: Prescribing medication to a patient with PKU.

Duty-Type: Healthcare professionals have a duty to consider the amount of phenylalanine in medication before prescribing to a patient with PKU.

Transition: Prescribing medication triggers a transition in the institutional view, creating a fact that the medication contains phenylalanine.

Event: Prescribing medication is an event that lacks performing and recipient actors.

Fact: The medication contains phenylalanine.

Invariant: The combined daily amount of phenylalanine from all sources, including the medication, must not exceed a certain threshold for patients with PKU.

Violation: If the combined daily amount of phenylalanine from all sources, including the medication, exceeds the threshold, it is a violation of the invariant.

Compliance: The prescription of medication is considered compliant if the combined daily amount of phenylalanine from all sources, including the medication, is below the threshold.

Scenario Assessment: Evaluate the scenario of prescribing medication to a patient with PKU for compliance with the invariant.

Rule: Do not use Apresoline if you have coronary artery disease or rheumatic heart disease affecting the mitral valve.

Scenario: Using Apresoline while having coronary artery disease or rheumatic heart disease affecting the mitral valve.

Abstract Syntax: Apresoline should not be used under the following conditions: coronary artery disease or rheumatic heart disease affecting the mitral valve.

Example: An example of this rule being applied would be if a person with coronary artery disease or rheumatic heart disease affecting the mitral valve were prescribed Apresoline.

Type Redefinition: The type ""disease"" can be redefined to include coronary artery disease and rheumatic heart disease affecting the mitral valve for domain-specific use.

Script: The action of taking Apresoline while having coronary artery disease or rheumatic heart disease affecting the mitral valve.

Input Files: The input files for this scenario would include type declarations for ""disease"" and ""medication"", domain-specific type redefinitions for ""disease"", initialization statements for the person's medical conditions, and scenario statements for taking Apresoline.

Facts and Configurations: The fact that the person has coronary artery disease and/or rheumatic heart disease affecting the mitral valve forms the initial configuration.

Derivation Clauses: The type declaration for ""disease"" may have optional derivation clauses that specify the presence of coronary artery disease or rheumatic heart disease affecting the mitral valve.

Fact Types: The fact that the person should not take Apresoline can be derived based on the presence of coronary artery disease or rheumatic heart disease affecting the mitral valve.

Act-Types: The action of taking Apresoline involves the performing actor (the person) and the recipient actor (the medication). The post-condition of this action is that the person takes Apresoline.

Duty-Types: It is the duty of the person to not take Apresoline while having coronary artery disease or rheumatic heart disease affecting the mitral valve. The claimant in this situation is the person with the disease, and the duty holder is the person prescribing the medication. The violation condition is that the person has coronary artery disease or rheumatic heart disease affecting the mitral valve.

Transitions: The action of taking Apresoline triggers a transition, changing the institutional view by creating the fact that the person has taken Apresoline.

Actions vs. Events: The action of taking Apresoline involves performing and recipient actors, while an event would lack these actors.

Invariants: The language supports invariants to ensure that the person does not take Apresoline while having coronary artery disease or rheumatic heart disease affecting the mitral valve.

Violations: If the person takes Apresoline while having coronary artery disease or rheumatic heart disease affecting the mitral valve, it would be a violation of the invariant and reported as an inconsistency in the specification.

Compliance: The trace of the scenario can be evaluated for both action and duty compliance, where it would be found to be non-compliant.

Scenario Assessment: The scenario is evaluated for action and duty compliance based on the initial configuration of the person having coronary artery disease or rheumatic heart disease affecting the mitral valve.

Trace Recording: The trace of the scenario records the fact that the person took Apresoline, aiding in reproducing and explaining the decision-making process.

Negative Boolean Sentences: The scenario can be annotated with the negative Boolean sentence ""NOT(take Apresoline)"" to indicate that the person should not take Apresoline."

Post-conditions: NOT(use(Drug, while(taking(Medication))))

Duty-Types:
Duty-types involve duty holders and claimants with violation conditions.

Duty do-not-use:
Holder = Medication
Claimant = Drug
Violation conditions: use(Drug, while(taking(Medication))

Transitions:
Actions and events trigger transitions, changing institutional views by creating or terminating facts.

Actions vs. Events:
Actions and events differ; events lack performing and recipient actors.

Invariants:
The language supports invariants that must hold true in every reachable configuration.

Invariants:
NOT(use(Drug, while(taking(Medication)))

Violations:
Invariant violations are reported to identify inconsistencies in specifications.

Compliance:
A trace can be action-compliant, duty-compliant, both, or neither.

Scenario Assessment:
Evaluate scenarios for action and duty compliance based on the initial configuration.

Trace Recording:
Traces record normative positions and relations, aiding in reproducing and explaining decision-making processes.

Negative Boolean sentences are annotated using NOT(...)

Type Declaration: Risperdal Consta

Scenario: Risperdal Consta may cause weight gain, which can have negative effects on your health.

Abstract Syntax: Type Declaration: Risperdal Consta

Example: Example specification for Risperdal Consta weight gain is provided.

Type Redefinition: Risperdal Consta can be redefined for individual use.

Scripts: Scripts can be used to monitor and record weight measurements.

Input Files: Use input files for Risperdal Consta, including type declarations, individual redefinitions, and weight measurement statements.

Facts and Configurations: Facts represent the effects of Risperdal Consta on weight gain and health, forming configurations.

Derivation Clauses: Type declarations may have optional derivation clauses (Boolean expressions) that define the conditions for weight gain.

Fact Types: Facts can be 'derived' or 'postulated' based on the presence of derivation clauses.

Act-Types: Act-types define actions with the actor being the doctor and the recipient being the patient. These actions have post-conditions that change configurations.

Duty-Types: Duty-types involve the doctor as the duty holder and the patient as the claimant, with violation conditions if weight gain is significant.

Transitions: Weight gain triggers transitions, changing the institutional view and creating or terminating facts.

Actions vs. Events: The action of regularly measuring body weight differs from the event of weight gain, as the former lacks performing and recipient actors.

Invariants: The language supports invariants that must hold true in every reachable configuration, such as regular weight measurements by the doctor.

Violations: Invariant violations, such as failure to regularly measure weight, are reported to identify inconsistencies in specifications.

Compliance: A trace can be action-compliant, duty-compliant, both, or neither, depending on the regularity of weight measurements and the extent of weight gain.

Scenario Assessment: Evaluate scenarios for action and duty compliance based on the initial configuration.

Trace Recording: Traces record normative positions and relations, aiding in reproducing and explaining decision-making processes related to weight gain from Risperdal Consta.

Negative Boolean Sentences: Any negative effects of Risperdal Consta on weight gain are annotated using NOT(...)."

Type Declaration:
Synthroid: Medication

Scenario:
Synthroid should not be used to treat obesity or weight problems.
Statement:
NOT(Synthroid treats obesity OR weight problems)

Abstract Syntax:
Medication Synthroid

Example:
Example specification for medication use: Synthroid is not to be used for treating obesity or weight problems.

Type Redefinition:
Medication can be redefined for specific medical conditions.

Script:
Script to follow for medication use: Do not use Synthroid for treating obesity or weight problems.

Input Files:
To assess cases, use four input files: medication type declarations, medical condition-specific medication redefinitions, initialization statements, and medication use statements.

Fact and Configurations:
Facts represent the current medication use and form configurations.

Derivation Clauses:
Type declarations may have optional derivation clauses (Boolean expressions) that define which instances are true.

Fact Types:
Facts can be 'derived' or 'postulated' based on the presence of derivation clauses.

Act-Types:
Act-types define actions with performing and recipient actors. Actions have post-conditions that change configurations.

Duty-Types:
Duty-types involve duty holders and claimants with violation conditions.

Transitions:
Actions and events trigger transitions, changing medication use views by creating or terminating facts.

Actions vs. Events:
Actions and events differ; events lack performing and recipient actors.

Invariants:
The language supports invariants that must hold true in every reachable configuration.

Violations:
Invariant violations are reported to identify inconsistencies in medication use specifications.

Compliance:
A trace can be action-compliant, duty-compliant, both, or neither.

Scenario Assessment:
Evaluate medication use scenarios for action and duty compliance based on the initial configuration.

Trace Recording:
Traces record normative positions and relations, aiding in reproducing and explaining decision-making processes.

Negative Boolean Sentences:
Annotations are used to indicate negative statements, such as NOT(Synthroid treats obesity OR weight problems)."

Type Declaration:
type Medicine

Scenario:
Statements:
1. Medicine may cause lightheadedness, dizziness, or fainting.
2. Inform doctor about alcohol consumption or use of pain relievers or sleeping pills.

Abstract Syntax:
Medicine specifications consist of type declarations.

Example:
Example specifications like the interactions between medicine and alcohol, pain relievers, or sleeping pills are provided.

Type Redefinition:
Types can be redefined for specific interactions.

Scripts:
Scripts are sequences of statements and queries that describe interactions between medicine and other substances.

Input Files:
To assess interactions, use four input files: type declarations, specific type redefinitions, initialization statements, and scenario statements.

Facts and Configurations:
Facts represent the current interactions between medicine and other substances, forming configurations.

Derivation Clauses:
Type declarations may have optional derivation clauses (Boolean expressions) that define which interactions are true.

Fact Types:
Facts can be 'derived' or 'postulated' based on the presence of derivation clauses.

Act-Types:
Act-types define actions with performing and recipient actors. Actions have post-conditions that change configurations.

Duty-Types:
Duty-types involve duty holders and claimants with violation conditions.

Transitions:
Actions and events trigger transitions, changing institutional views by creating or terminating facts.

Actions vs. Events:
Actions and events differ; events lack performing and recipient actors.

Invariants:
The language supports invariants that must hold true in every reachable configuration.

Violations:
Invariant violations are reported to identify inconsistencies in specifications.

Compliance:
A trace can be action-compliant, duty-compliant, both, or neither.

Scenario Assessment:
Evaluate scenarios for action and duty compliance based on the initial configuration.

Trace Recording:
Traces record normative positions and relations, aiding in reproducing and explaining decision-making processes.

Negative Boolean Sentences:
Interactions with alcohol, narcotic pain relievers, or sleeping pills are annotated using NOT(...)
